## Supported Platforms

A **supported platform** refers to a combination of hardware and operating system where the software is actively tested through continuous integration (CI). A platform is considered **supported** if all CI tests pass consistently, ensuring compatibility and reliability.  

The following tables list currently supported platforms:

| Hardware | OS | Reference Deployment | CI Passes |
|------|----------|----|-----------|
| BeagleBone Black | VxWorks 7 | [`fprime-vxworks-reference`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-vxworks-reference) | |
| Raspberry Pi | Linux | [`fprime-workshop-led-blinker`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-workshop-led-blinker) | |
